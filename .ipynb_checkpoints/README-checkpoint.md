## Welcome

This repository contains work relevant to E. Fernandez's dissertation research, specifically Chapters 3 and 4. 

`INFO.txt` is, in essence, a log diary of the work completed in this repository. It is a mess, haha. 

The main focus of this work is identifying forecasts of opportunity of stratosphere-troposphere coupling using one-dimensional features from the stratosphere. Primarily, this research explores the applicability of ellipse metrics describing the geometry of the polar vortex. 

Code for calculating those geometries can be found in [this repository.](https://github.com/emf98/SPVMD).
