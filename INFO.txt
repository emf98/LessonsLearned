I created this repo to show my work from the Lessons Learned paper/play around a little bit with some different data.
The OG data only covers Nov-Mar, 1959/1960 to 2020/2021.
I changed it to extend to Oct-Mar for the normalizing/averaging for testing purposes/to extend the data some. Not sure if this was necessarily needed?

Model skill did not necessarily change with this modification. All it really did was change the importance of GPH. 
Prob distributions are confusing. 
I will have to discuss these with Zheng. Maybe it will be more worth it to not do a LL paper?

As long as the SHAP plots make sense, I will probably stick with the back-extended data just for my own mental sanity and consistency.
