I created this repo to show my work from the Lessons Learned paper/play around a little bit with some different data.
The OG data only covers Nov-Mar, 1959/1960 to 2020/2021.
I changed it to extend to Oct-Mar for the normalizing/averaging for testing purposes/to extend the data some. Not sure if this was necessarily needed?

Model skill did not necessarily change with this modification. All it really did was change the importance of GPH. 
Prob distributions are confusing. 
I will have to discuss these with Zheng. Maybe it will be more worth it to not do a LL paper?

As long as the SHAP plots make sense, I will probably stick with the back-extended data just for my own mental sanity and consistency.

Okay, so after some deliberation ... it seems we have reached a consensus on what is going to happen here. 
My work is re-aligning with my WINGS proposal. It is just a matter of how exactly to skin the proverbial cat. 

The short story is that the FOR from the RF model, particularly when switching forecast regions, increase substantially. The model performs better than climo with >0 BSS. This does not change dramatically when comparing the two models ... which drives home Zheng's point of "why use a more complicated model if you do not have to"

The only thing that changed was the extent of the input data, adding in ~8% of data, and a shifting of the running mean to earlier. This caused GPH to increase in importance, likely attributed to the model favoring that tropospheric relationship. I will need to discuss this with Andrea. I do not think there is a direct NAO teleconnection observed here because it is not physically consistent. 
However, in more fascinating observations, the distributions of features are the same for BOTH forecast areas. This is GREAT. It means that when the model is confident for both regions, its for the same reasons. 
:)

Same with SE US, just checked.

I am briefly going to test all of this using anomalies instead of just running mean values. 
I also switched GPH to 100 hPa.

Nothing really changed except the features.

Changed the validation and testing windows to 15% eac or ~10 years to match what was used for the EOF model. 

There is some overfitting in the European model before conducting feature selection. This is less prevalent for the other regions. After feature selection, model overfitting is reduced. 

All models look good. Evidence for increased instances for opportunity forecasts. 

Now I am going to redo the boxplots with the increased window. Hopefully to compare with the EOF model. 

My initial comparison with the EOF model shows consistent FOs from the 100hPa GPH, which is the most important feature for the RF model, however the information from the U-wind is different. Almost opposite. It's almost directly showing that the EOF model does better at picking up strong vortex signals connected with positive temperature anomalies, same with negative and a disrupted vortex. It is almost like the EOF model does a better job at picking up known sources of stratospheric variability and connecting that to skillful predictions of temperature anomalies... but the RF is picking up on other non-specific stratospheric varaibilities related to the vortex itself and its location, etc. It gets more information from the vortex behavior and uses that to make decisions, and those are the same regardless of region. 

I would like to see whether the EOF FOs change with forecast region. 
I will try that on monday. 
After that, I will write the outline for this new LL paper and begin work on expanding the previous one.

I am trying to test whether the FOs change within the EOF LSTM by switching to the Canadian forecast region.

And now I would like to see how many of these events overlap between the LSTM and RF models.

I have a thought. 
I am currently unsure whether or not it makes sense that the FOs show the same thing. This could be a good thing. This could imply that there is some other type of stratospheric variability that is crucial in improving forecasts in this observed range with our features... OR it could be wrong. I am feeling motivated to look again at shifting the temps/inputs forward to November for such a prediction to see if that changes the FOs and model skill. This will also make comparing indices with the other model easier, selfishly.
